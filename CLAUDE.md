**CRITICAL**
- ALWAYS: Commit and push code changes after completing ANY task - no exceptions!
- NEVER: leave uncommitted or unpushed changes - always maintain a consistent and backed-up repository state
- ALWAYS: Before declaring a task as complete, test if the app builds using `npm run build`!
- ALWAYS: Before declaring a task as complete, test if the app has linting errors using `npm run lint`!
- Keep the App modular!
- ALWAYS: Before implementing any feature, do a web research for best practices in 2025.
- ALWAYS: Before implementing any feature, do a web research if a framework component (angular, ionic) exists that covers the requirements
- !!!ALWAYS work on the main branch in the private repository!!!!
- NEVER MERGE TO release branch on your own!
