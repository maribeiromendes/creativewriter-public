   - Start writing with AI assistance!

### Development Setup

For development or customization, clone the repository:

1. **Clone and setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarcoDroll/creativewriter2.git
   cd creativewriter2
   ```

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 20+
   - npm 10+
   - Angular CLI 19+

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Configuration

#### AI Providers
Configure your AI providers in the application settings:
- **OpenRouter**: Add your API key for access to multiple models
- **Google Gemini**: Direct integration with Gemini models
- **Custom Endpoints**: Support for self-hosted models

#### Database
The application uses PouchDB for local storage with optional CouchDB sync:
- Local-only mode works out of the box
- For sync, configure CouchDB connection in settings

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- No need to clone the repository
- ~500MB-1GB RAM per instance
- Port 3080 available (or configure a different port)

### Single Instance
Simply download and run:
```bash
mkdir creativewriter && cd creativewriter
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoDroll/creativewriter2/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```
Then configure your AI API keys in Settings after accessing the app at http://localhost:3080.

### Multiple Instances
Run multiple isolated instances on the same host:

```bash
# Instance 1 - Personal Writing
mkdir writer-personal && cd writer-personal
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoDroll/creativewriter2/main/docker-compose.yml
echo "PORT=3080" > .env
docker compose -p writer-personal up -d

# Instance 2 - Work Projects (different directory)
mkdir ../writer-work && cd ../writer-work
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoDroll/creativewriter2/main/docker-compose.yml
echo "PORT=3081" > .env
docker compose -p writer-work up -d
```

Each instance maintains its own database and settings, so configure API keys separately in each instance's Settings.

See [README-MULTI-INSTANCE.md](README-MULTI-INSTANCE.md) for detailed multi-instance setup.
