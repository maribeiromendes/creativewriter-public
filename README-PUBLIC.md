## 🤖 Built with AI-Powered Development

This application was developed using AI-powered pair programming with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), showcasing the future of software development through human-AI collaboration.

**Important Note:** While AI significantly accelerates development, creating production-ready applications like CreativeWriter still requires:
- 💰 **Investment**: Paid Claude subscription for development
- 🧠 **Expertise**: Deep software engineering knowledge to guide the AI
- ⏱️ **Time & Effort**: Many hours of focused human-AI collaboration
- 🎯 **Vision**: Clear architectural decisions and quality standards

The AI is a powerful tool, but the human developer's expertise, creativity, and effort remain essential for creating quality software.
